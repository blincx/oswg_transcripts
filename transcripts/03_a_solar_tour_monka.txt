(Introduction)

Friends, the following discourse, titled 
"A Solar Tour", is given by a great Space Being,
whose residence is on the planet Hussar, or in our language,
Mars. 

This one, who is one of the most widely known beings from another
planet, is known as Mon-ka. We believe you will find this talk
interesting, informative, and thought-provoking. It is our honor
to present at this time: Mon-ka.

(Discourse)

Greetings in the Light of Our Radiant One. I am Monka.

At this time, I shall conduct you, on a tour of our solar system.
As if all of you were present aboard one of our craft. 

Leave your planet's surface, and our craft gradually spirals away,
towards the light of this system, the Sun.

The first object which draws our atttention, is tthe planett known to
your planet as Mercury. 

As we draw closer to this one, we notice the great contrast between
Light and Darkness. We view its rotation: burningly hot on one side,
and bitterly cold on the other. This planet, my brothers, we use
as an observation and experimental station, due to its close proximity
to our Sun, it's proved most valuable. There is no native life on this
planett. The only life exhibited is from our peoples' installations and bases. 

Much knowledge of benefit to Mankind has come from this one. 
Now, having observed it's barrenness, we progress outward 
and that which lies before us, is indeed a beautiful sight. 
The planet spoken of in your mythology, the goddess of Love,
and truly, the sight of this one, wrapped in its dazzling gown of
white clouds, is one of great Beauty. I speak now, of Venus.

The Sun's rays, glance brilliantly off these clouds, imparting an aura
of great Loving. These clouds are officially maintained, to help create a Greenhouse Effect on this planet's surface. And as we descend,
we pass through a tremendous Ocean, of ionizing force. Now, beneath these clouds, which do not completely shield the Sun's rays from this one's surface, we behold a planet of regal majesty - almost as beauttiful as your Earth.

Here, lies a great race of people. We see great and mighty things.
Ocean crafts. Color rampant everywhere. And, a feeling of warmth and
gaiety. Indeed, these people are highly regarded throughout this and many other solar systems. Feeling that expression known as Love,
vibrating in the very air about us, we note, that even your music,
speaks of these things. As well as compassion. Of great joys and
sorrows; of feelings, unnumbered in their subtlety, of the emotions of these people - filling the very air about us. This planet, my brothers,
represents an evolution, only a few thousand years in advance of your own. 

This life is native to this one, and besides yourselves, is the youngest in this solar system.

Now let us leave this one and proceed to one perhaps more familiar to you: your own planet. The green emerald of the solar system, the Earth.
This is a most inspiring sight. Your planet, my brothers, is one which has contributed much to its neighbors. But since we are speaking of other things at the moment, let us move on. 

And proceeding outward, we see that bright red-green in your evening skies. That planett known to your astronomers as Mars. 
Unfortunateely, due to your mythology, the terms of violence is associated with it, which is quite untrue. The only violence on this, my planet, is in our struggle against the elements. 

Now as we glide in close to this one, we find evidence, that indicates
that Man has been on this one for a considerable length of time. 
We see the remains of great civilizations, along thet silent length
of the canals. But, the planett is not dead, as we note, that a great
deal of activity is centered, in certain places. And that huge shafts
lead into this planet's interior. For you see, people of Earh, most of our living area and industry is underground. As our craft circles this one, we see evidence here of great actvitiy. Our instrumentst reccords the presence of vast industrial progerss. Here we ddiscover that tmostt of hte spacecrarrftt used by hte confedereattion, in this sector fo space, is manufactured. Here the civvilization represents 
a picture of great antiquity. But the very nature of the planet's appearance, indicates a type of vitality, a drive, that suggests monumental effort, and the spark that has created a people, and a race, that survives.

On our left, we see high mountain chains, purple plateaus, crimson deserts, and at the poles as our craft approaches, a lovely green area, where a city of scintillating splendor greets our eyes.
Mars is far from the usual decay, thought to be a partner of great age, as our eyes record. Since this is my planet, I thought it in order to explain these things. Now let us leave this one and spiral outwards again. 

And Lo! what do we behold, but a swirling dervish! A ring of tiny fragments - that known to you, as the Asteroid Belt. The remains of a planet. These remnants swirlaround my planet, and the one from which life sprang in this system. 

We look closer now and behold the mightiest of all the planets of the solar system, the one known as Jupiter. And truly this is a singular sight to gaze upon! With its many moons circulating about it. Those that were created, and those natural from the point of creation. 

We look down, and sigh. It begins to dim one's comprehension of size. 
We see huge cloud flotillas, mighty lands abounding, tremendous oceans, and the oldest civilization present in this solar system.

Here reside those beings which overlook man's affairs in this sector
of space. This is truly the birthplace of life upon our planet. 
Gaze, with wonder and awe - look upon the majesty, of this, the home,
and cradle, of Man in this solar system.

For here we see, and here dwells, those mighty beings of the Adamic Race. The shimmering haze about this one, blinds your telescopes to the realities present, or the effects of light distorted by this one's glowing fields of force, hides the truth from the eyes of men, upon your planet. 

So we find the air is light and balmy. It is vibrant. For we see an atmosphere golden in color, and great beings, native to this one, whose skin is of golden radiance. Beings, fair-haired and majestic. We also see here a civilization that exists partly between the physical and the etheric. 

Whenever we are close to this one, our very beings leap in recognition, and we send our thoughts of love and gratitude. 

Let us now proceed again, outwards, and we approach the planet known to you as Saturn. The Law Guardian for this System. Here are found the courts of Equality. Here again, your music describes compassion and understanding, the necessary ingredients of true Guardianship. 

In the hours of Daylight, brief as they are, the Sun's rays glance off the tall marble structures. We see halls, we see pavillions. Evverywhere about us, the architecture seems to stand symbolic. Symbolic of these ones' administration of the Great Radiance. 

Here also, we find a native race, whose very essence, is a Life of Balance and Harmony, brought about by the understanding of the Great Laws of Cause and Effect. 

Now we gradually spiral upwards again in our craft, we see their moon, their areas of recreation, set as they are amid the halo, shimmering lights provided by their force fields, described as they are by your people as 'rings'. 

We are afforded a vista of truly enchanting splendor, arising vast beyond comprehension, open vistas to our eyes. Watch as this one whirls through the brief hours of daylight and dusk. 

And now, as we move on, and spiral out - we come next to a lovely sight. The planet known to you as Neptune. The bearded one, with his
trident. We see here, my brothers, a planet whose atmosphere glows with an electric blue color. 

We see evidence, as we circle closer, that here, evolution traversing here along a different route, has progressed through the physical, and all life exists as Etheric. We find a native race, existing in the shadowy outline of core-steady Light, and they welcome our Presence. 

A feeling of great Joy pervades our bodies, as these ones unleash wave and wave of welcome. As we park our craft and hover, we see wave after
wave of color greet our eyes. 

For, there is little to see, upon this one's surface. Lovely as it is.
For all life seems to abound in the very air itself. Great shadowy outlines of these ones, lift upon the currents of the air itself, from one place to another. The clouds about us shape and re-shape in formations resembling truly Cathedrals in the Sky, as these ones connect their thoughts to the moulding of Matter itself. 

We sense the relation as beside our craft, a shape begins to materialize and the thought invades our mind, that this is a gift,
in appreciation of our visit. 

Below us, there forms from thought alone, a replica of your Earth, conceived by these great minds, rotating slowly on it's axis, bathed in the rich and molt colors, known throughout the Galaxy.

Visitors from many regions stop here to see the greatest works of mental art exhibited. And to these people, this art is their export. 
Their gift to Man, scattered as he is, along the Galactic Lens.

For these ones provide Beauty, as their talent. Let us hope, my brothers, that soon you shall witness these things for yourselves.

Let us move on now though, and examine the next site. For we see the planet known as Uranus. Here our eyes tell us, is not a cold, frigid desolate waste, but a certain warmth, though coldness encompasseth as we descend and see a lovely land of rolling meadows and softly flowing forests. There is very little water on this planet, but the rich clouds above us, do assure an adequate supply for the lush vegetation presentt below on the surface.

Here also is a native race, wise with experience, controlling their ionosphere to produce this garden spot at the near edge of the Solar System.

Now as we continue gliding along, we see the tiniest of coves, little bays and inlets, along the coast, the only Ocean present.

Here also, we come upon the Uranians! A race noted for their powers
of observation. A race that provides trained navigators for the space fleets of many galaxies. 

Strange, is it not, that these people are so noted?
These men prowl the uttermost reaches of that known as the Universe, always providing that unerring sense that is theirs, and leaving behind a planet that is one of the most pleasant recreational areas in this solar system. For Uranus is noted as a garden spot, a place where one can come to shed everyday problems of life, temporarily, and enjoy the warm contentment of the mighty forests and plains. Many of our people come here to spend time such as many of your people enjoy outdoor activities.

Here the dreamlike quality of the air itself seems possessed of healing qualities, and the scattered cities provide one with the sense of quiet often needed. Some of the great institutions of learning, also exist here. 

But now let us move out again, and view the remaining planets left, the one you know as Pluto. 

The dazzling white glare of this one can be seen from a great distance, and would seem to indicate the presence of perhaps a frigid world. But again, our eyes are deceived. For as we spiral inwards, we notice that no frozen wastes greet our eyes, but instead, lightly rolling dunes of bleached white sand. For my brothers, Pluto is an arid desert world.
No native life is in evidence.

But as we swing around this one's equator, we do notice the presence of Man, and on a gigantic scale. For here are the great space ports,
the trade centers, the pilots that r
